# CNN-based-CAPTCHA-recognition
Python implementation of a CNN able to recognize CAPTCHAs taken from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parsasam/captcha-dataset?select=115rB.jpg) dataset.

## Structure:
1) [Dataset download and first analysis](https://github.com/marcoimbee/CNN-based-CAPTCHA-recognition/blob/main/notebooks/%5B1.0%5D%20Dataset%20download%20and%20first%20analysis.ipynb)
2) [First CNN architecture and performance analysis](https://github.com/marcoimbee/CNN-based-CAPTCHA-recognition/blob/main/notebooks/%5B2.0%5D%20First%20CNN%20architecture%20and%20performance%20analysis.ipynb)
3) [Improved architecture and performance analysis](https://github.com/marcoimbee/CNN-based-CAPTCHA-recognition/blob/main/notebooks/%5B3.0%5D%20Improved%20architecture%20and%20performance%20analysis.ipynb)

## Note:
The project has been developed for the "Intelligent Systems" course at the University of Pisa.
